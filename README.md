# Compost Worm Tycoon

## So, What’s This About?
This is a landing page aimed at generating some excitement for a possible future game called “Compost Worm Tycoon.”
The whole idea was to generate traction so people can get interested in the game while showing off some of its fun features.
I just wanted to keep things clean, simple, and leverage the trends of sustainability.

> **FYI:** I’m not the usual Front End Dev, nor did I have access to a UI Designer.

## What I Tried to Build
- **Responsive Landing Page**:
  I attempted to design a responsive landing page that works well on various devices—laptops, tablets, phones, you name it.
  No stretched-out or weird layouts (at least, I hope not).
- **Interactive Features**:
  Dropdown menus, a survey, smooth navigation—your usual bells and whistles to make it easier for people to click around.
- **Fun Media Stuff**:
  I added a video and a GIF to keep it from being boring. Let’s be honest, visuals make everything better.
- **Organized Code**:
  I tried to keep things neat and separate—HTML, CSS, JavaScript, all in their own lanes. No wild spaghetti code here.

## What Went Right
Some things actually turned out pretty well, thanks to the lessons I followed:
- **Responsive Design**:
  Media queries were a game-changer for making the layout work across all screen sizes. Shoutout to Lesson 307.5 for teaching the basics.
- **JavaScript Features**:
  Dropdown menus, smooth scrolling, and email form validation were straight out of Lessons 308.1 and 308.2.
  Honestly, this was the most fun part of the project.
- **CSS Animations**:
  I added hover effects on buttons and dropdowns to make things feel interactive. Lesson 307.5 came through here too.

## Stuff I Had to Figure Out
Not everything was in the lessons, so I had to piece a few things together myself:
- **Adding a GIF**:
  Sounds easy, right? Nope. Getting the GIF to work was way more annoying than expected. File paths were picky, and it took some trial and error.
- **Dropdown Menu Styling**:
  W3Schools really saved me here. Adjusting hover effects and messing with the z-index was more frustrating than expected.
- **Form Validation**:
  Regex. Enough said. It was totally new to me, so I had to Google like crazy. After a lot of tries, I finally got it working.

## How I Kept Things Organized
- **HTML**:
  Broke it into sections—features, how it works, survey, etc.—so it’s easy to find what you need without digging through a mess.
- **CSS**:
  All the styles are in one clean file. Inline styles? Only if I was desperate.
- **JavaScript**:
  Kept all the interactive stuff in one script: dropdowns, smooth scrolling, form validation, it’s all in there.

## What Could’ve Been Better
- Saving survey responses so they don’t disappear when the page refreshes would’ve been awesome.
- Adding animations with something like GSAP would’ve made the site feel smoother and cooler.
- Compressing images and GIFs would’ve sped up load times a lot. Definitely something to work on.

## What I Learned
While I don’t see myself aiming to become a Front End Developer, I was able to put this site together with basic functionality.
To be more competitive as a Fullstack Developer, I’ll need to enhance my front-end and UI skills.
My strengths lie more in data, project management, and business logic.
